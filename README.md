This repository encapsulates the culmination of a 4-week AI Capstone project using Keras, a key component of the IBM AI Engineering course. The primary objective was to develop a robust image classification model to determine if a stone is cracked or intact. The project processed a dataset of 40,000 images, with 30,000 used for training and 10,000 for validation.</p>

<p><strong>Week 4 Assignment:</strong><br>
The final assignment involved a comparative analysis between two pre-trained models, ResNet50 and VGG16, implemented using Keras. The models were trained for 2 epochs, and the performance metrics are summarized in the table below:</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
Based on the performance metrics, it is evident that VGG16 outperforms ResNet50 for this specific dataset. With a validation accuracy of 99.81%, VGG16 is deemed more suitable for the task at hand. The successful completion of this final assignment resulted in a perfect grade of 100%.</p>
